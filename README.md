# Hello and welcome! üëã

I'm Manuela from Colombia, a sixth-semester student of Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to develop projects focused on data analysis, which has allowed me to achieve academic excellence. Additionally, I have a strong passion for taking extra courses in my free time. I am enthusiastic about projects with social impact that help me develop my skills, and as a fun fact, I really like cows.

## üî¨ Research and Study Groups

My passion for research has led me to participate in several research groups at my university:

- **Amauta**: Research group on Environmental Thought and Southern Epistemologies.
- **Data Analytics and Storage Group**: I am an active member and participate in key projects of the group.

Moreover, I was part of the **Data Analysis Research Group**, where I had the opportunity to present a project on Power BI at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Occidente on April 26, 2022.
